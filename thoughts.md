# Takeaways from Mod 0 for success at Turing
* Everyone is sharing the thought that the rest of the students are ahead of them. Take a breath and focus on going at the speed you need to understand the material, not the speed you think everyone else is going at
* You are so much more capable of coding than you give yourself credit for. Trust your instincts, be thorough, and reflect often.


# New strategies to commit to
* Using Google calendar to block out work times, breaks, reminders, and other commitments. Using my paper planner at the beginning of the week to plan out daily assignment goals in order to meet the entire week's required material. Then most importantly, track actual progress of the assignments from day to day.
* Continue to take written notes on lessons, digital notes on responses/reflections, and review both at the end of the day.

## Huge shoutout to __Amy__ for continuing to calm my nerves about the overwhelming new world of coding, new way of learning through Turing, being understanding and supportive with making accommodations for my disabilities, and being so approachable when you ned help with a problem - no  matter how small!!
